🌐 Web 7.0 — Decentralized Infrastructure Project

Web 7.0 is a research and development initiative focused on defining a new network paradigm built on the peer-to-peer architecture of Hyphanet (the successor to Freenet).

The project aims to address the structural limitations of the contemporary web by prioritizing:

🛡️ Data sovereignty

🏗️ Infrastructure resilience

🔓 Technological independence

🔐 Native privacy

🏛️ Core Pillars
🧩 1. Decentralized Architecture

Adoption of P2P systems to eliminate single points of failure and reduce dependency on centralized infrastructures.

🕊️ 2. Digital Integrity & Freedom

Implementation of censorship-resistant protocols to ensure the free circulation of information.

🔒 3. Privacy by Design

Development of systems with built-in anonymity and native end-to-end encryption at the architectural level.

🌱 4. Sustainable Model

Design of an ecosystem free from invasive advertising and tracking mechanisms.

🛠️ Technical Objectives

🌍 Hyphanet Infrastructure Expansion
Optimization and distribution of nodes to enhance network resilience and scalability.

📜 Web 7.0 Standards Definition
Research and development of decentralized identity protocols and distributed authentication systems.

🤝 Open Source Collaboration
Creation of rigorous technical documentation and contribution guidelines to streamline developer onboarding.

👥 Community & Coordination

The project is developed openly and transparently.
Developers 👨‍💻, security researchers 🧠, and advocates of digital freedom 🗽 are invited to contribute to the roadmap.
