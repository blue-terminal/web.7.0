🌐 Web 7.0 — Decentralized Infrastructure Project

Web 7.0 is a research-driven initiative exploring a next-generation decentralized web infrastructure built on the peer-to-peer architecture of Hyphanet (successor to Freenet).

The project focuses on infrastructure-level decentralization rather than application-layer trends, aiming to address structural weaknesses of the modern web.

🎯 Vision

Web 7.0 is designed around four foundational principles:

🛡️ Data Sovereignty — Users retain control over their data.

🏗️ Infrastructure Resilience — Elimination of single points of failure.

🔐 Native Privacy — End-to-end encryption and anonymity by default.

🌍 Technological Independence — Reduced reliance on centralized platforms.

🏛️ Core Architecture

Web 7.0 is structured in conceptual layers:

🧱 Layer 1 — Network Infrastructure

Built on distributed node architecture powered by Hyphanet.

🔑 Layer 2 — Identity & Authentication (Research Phase)

Exploration of decentralized identity models and distributed trust mechanisms.

🌐 Layer 3 — Application Interface Layer

Web-accessible services operating over censorship-resistant infrastructure.

🔍 Threat Model

Web 7.0 is designed to mitigate:

Centralized censorship

Infrastructure shutdown attempts

Mass surveillance architectures

Tracking-based monetization ecosystems

🛠️ Technical Objectives (2026)

📡 Expand and optimize Hyphanet node deployment

📜 Draft decentralized identity protocol specifications

📖 Publish technical documentation and architecture papers

🧪 Develop experimental infrastructure prototypes

📊 Project Status

Web 7.0 is currently in the research and architectural design phase.
Initial documentation and experimental specifications will be published progressively.
